# Customer Support System - Enhancing Customer Service in Electronics

## Implementation Steps

Our system is designed to work through a sequence of steps:

### Step 1: Input Moderation

1. **Inappropriate Prompt Detection**: Ensures customer interactions remain respectful and appropriate.

2. **Response Generation**: Craft 100-word responses using chatGPT for engaging customer interactions.

3. **Output Evaluation**: Ensures that the generated responses are suitable for the context.

4. **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Leverages OpenAI's Moderation API to maintain response appropriateness.

### Step 2: Service Request Classification

- Efficiently categorizes service requests, directing them to the appropriate service channels for a prompt resolution.

### Step 3: Chain of Thought Reasoning

- Utilizes Chain of Thought Reasoning to provide comprehensive responses to customer inquiries, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Step 4: Output Validation

This step involves thorough output validation to maintain the highest quality in responses.

- **Test Case 1 - Factual Accuracy**: Ensures responses are factually accurate.

- **Test Case 2 - Fact-Checking**: Verifies the accuracy of responses, maintaining the quality of interactions.

### Step 5: Comprehensive Evaluation

- Compares responses with ideal answers to ensure customer interactions are accurate and efficient.

### Step 6: Advanced Evaluation

Our advanced evaluation is centered around product-based rubrics, ensuring the system's responses meet the highest standards.

- **Normal Assistant Answer Evaluation**: Aligns responses with ideal answers for standard interactions.

- **Abnormal Assistant Answer Evaluation**: Maintains high-quality interactions even when faced with non-standard responses.

By following these steps, you can provide a superior customer experience, elevating your role in delivering exceptional support in the electronics industry.
